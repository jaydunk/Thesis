I would like to thank the UCLA nuclear physics group, Brookhaven National Lab and the STAR experiment for giving me the opportunities and resources necessary for completing this dissertation. In particlar I owe thanks to my advisor Huan Huang who gave me guidance and mentorship, without which I would not have been able to complete this research. I would also like to thank Gang Wang for being an invaluable resource on the STAR experiment and the physics of heavy ion collisions in general. Also to Oleg Tsai who gave me the opportunity to work on very interesting R\&D projects. Thanks to all my collegues in the STAR experiment as well as all the students and researchers who have passed through UCLA's lab throughout the years I've been here. And finally, thank you to my family, who have always supported me in my education and without whom I would not be where I am today.
