\chapter{Identification of Non-photonic Electrons}

We discuss the procedure for identifying electrons in events at STAR and how we remove photonic background. We show the event and track selection criteria and then lastly we will analyze the efficiency for identifying background photonic electrons. The identification of non-photonic electrons (NPE) and efficiency thereof will be critical factors when we construct the NPE-hadron correlations in later chapters.
